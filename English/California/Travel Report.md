# Travel Report

## Introduction

I've traveled to *California, the golden state* about a month ago. I got back two weeks ago by the wonderful traveling method called *airplane*. I had a lot of fun and I wanted to visit my grandmother.

## Body

### Arrival

When I got from the plane, I had to wait in a *really long* line for about 1 hour just for the TSA team to take another 15 minutes to check my luggage. But at the end I still got through. I've heard that they are really strict on checking that no one gets through uninvited.

### First impression

As I got out of the Van Nuys Airport, I was stunned. Everything was so colorful and ful of life. I was ready to take the trip to Hollywood, Sequoia National Park and Big Sur Coast.

### Hollywood

From there I got an Uber and drove to the Hollywood Loft Apartments. That took about 20 minutes, so I quickly checked in in order to not loose more time. Then I visited my grandma in *Beverly Hills*. It was great, we hat some coffie, some cake and a laugh but then I had to say good bye after a few hours. Then I got to the walk of fame. There I saw many film names, actors' names and musicians' names. So, very famous people's names. Then I got to Van Nuys Airport again and I noticed that my flight was delayed, but luckly I still got in on time.

### Sequoia Nationl Park

A few hours later I arrived at Lone Pine Airport and saw the nature though the windows. As I got out, I quickly called a Taxi and we drove for a few hours to the Sequoia National Park Info Point. There I got a map for the area so I wouldn't get lost. As I walked through the red wood trees, I got to enjoy life really well. And the mountains were really great too. They even have snow. But I didn't get there :white_frowning_face:. After three hours I got back to Los Angeles and went to sleep: What an exciting day!

### Big Sur Coast Line

I got off at the Montery Airport, from which I drove to the Big Sur Coast Line. There I had a great time walking and looking at the coast. I got here a bit late, because I had lunch at my Grandma's and was here at 5:00 PM. Here I had a great time watching the sun set.

## Conclusion

I had a great time in California. I can not recommend this trip enough to emphersise wow great californias' nature is.
